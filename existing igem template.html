You are provided with this team page template with which to start the iGEM season.  You may choose to personalize it to fit your team but keep the same "look." Or you may choose to take your team wiki to a different level and design your own wiki.  You can find some examples <a href="http://2009.igem.org/Help:Template/Examples">HERE</a>.
</div>
<div id="warning" style="/*text-align: center;*/ font-weight: bold; font-size: small; /*color: #f6f6f6*/; padding: 5px;">

<li>project description</li>
<li>safety information (did your team take a safety training course? were you supervised in the lab?)</li>
<li>team attribution (who did what part of your project?)</li>
</ul>
You may also wish to add other page such as:
<ul style="font-weight:normal;">
<li>lab notebook</li>
<li>sponsor information</li>
