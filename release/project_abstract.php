            <p>This year, our aim is to mutate E.coli to create a semi-quantitative lactose biosensor; we intend to create three mutant operons on a single plasmid, with each operon responding to a different concentration of lactose in the environment the E.coli finds itself in. We plan to use red, yellow and green fluorescent proteins in a “traffic light” system, whereby the colour of the protein translated corresponds to the concentration of lactose, with red fluorescent protein denoting a high concentration of lactose, yellow fluorescent protein representing a low concentration of lactose and green fluorescent protein showing that there is no lactose present. It is our hope that this could potentially be used in allergy testing and in the analysis of food samples, and by a spectrum individuals who are lactose intolerant.</p>
